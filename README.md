## Problem Statement <a id="problem statement"></a>
Drone takeoff phase involves complex dynamics due to the interactions between the UAV’s propulsion system and environmental factors like wind and turbulence.  Improper takeoff can lead to crashes or unstable flight paths, posing safety risks to nearby people and structures and potential mission failure. Our goal of our work is to create safety take off control for crazyflie using model predictive control.

## Problem Statement <a id="problem_statement"></a>
The primary objective of this project is to develop a control system for fully non-linear quadrotor system that can achieve following tasks:
- Fast point stabilization 
- Follow trajectory to pass through gates precisely
- Avoid obstacles using state constraints
  
Quadrotors are widely used in various applications such as aerial photography, surveillance, delivery services and sports such as drone racing. However, their nonlinear dynamics and the presence of external disturbances make control a challenging task.

The insights gained pave the way for future innovations, offering the potential to revolutionize drone racing with cutting-edge algorithms and strategies. Additionally, addressing the nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances inherent in quadrotor systems is vital for ensuring safe and reliable operation in real-world scenarios. This project emphasizes the importance of MPC in overcoming these challenges, setting the stage for future advancements in drone racing technology.

### Quadrotor Dynamics

The quadrotor's dynamics are described by the following state-space equations, where the state vector includes positions, orientations, and their respective velocities, and the control inputs are the propeller speeds.

#### States

- Positions in the inertial frame: $$\( x, y, z \)$$ 
- Roll, pitch, and yaw angles: $$\( \phi, \theta, \psi \)$$ 
- Velocities in the inertial frame: $$\( \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z} \)$$ 
- Angular velocities: $$\( \dot{\phi}, \dot{\theta}, \dot{\psi} \)$$ 

#### Inputs
- : Propeller speeds: $$\( u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4 \)$$

#### Equations of Motion

1. **Position Dynamics:**  
   $$\dot{x} = v_x $$
   $$\dot{y} = v_y $$
   $$\dot{z} = v_z $$


2. **Orientation Dynamics:**
   $$\dot{\phi} = \omega_x $$
   $$\dot{\theta} = \omega_y $$
   $$\dot{\psi} = \omega_z $$

3. **Velocity Dynamics:**

   $$\dot{v_x} = \frac{1}{m}\left(\cos(\phi) \sin(\theta) \cos(\psi) + \sin(\phi) \sin(\psi)\right) f_1 - \frac{K_1 v_x}{m}$$
   $$\dot{v_y} = \frac{1}{m}\left(\cos(\phi) \sin(\theta) \sin(\psi) - \sin(\phi) \cos(\psi)\right) f_1 - \frac{K_2 v_y}{m}$$
   $$\dot{v_z} = -\frac{1}{m}\left(\cos(\psi) \cos(\theta)\right) f_1 + g - \frac{K_3 v_z}{m}$$


4. **Angular Velocity Dynamics:**
   $$\dot{\omega_x} = \frac{I_y - I_z}{I_x} \omega_y \omega_z + \frac{l}{I_x} f_2 - \frac{K_4 l}{I_x} \omega_x + \frac{J_r}{I_x} \omega_y (u_1 - u_2 + u_3 - u_4)$$
   $$\dot{\omega_y} = \frac{I_z - I_x}{I_y} \omega_x \omega_z + \frac{l}{I_y} f_3 - \frac{K_5 l}{I_y} \omega_y + \frac{J_r}{I_y} \omega_z (u_1 - u_2 + u_3 - u_4)$$
   $$\dot{\omega_z} = \frac{I_x - I_y}{I_z} \omega_x \omega_y + \frac{1}{I_z} f_4 - \frac{K_6}{I_z} \omega_z$$

#### Forces and Torques
- Thrust: $$f_1 = b(u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2 + u_4^2) $$
- Roll Moment: $$f_2 = b(-u_2^2 + u_4^2) $$
- Pitch Moment: $$f_3 = b(u_1^2 - u_3^2) $$
- Yaw Moment: $$f_4 = d(-u_1^2 + u_2^2 - u_3^2 + u_4^2) $$

### State and Input Constraints
#### State Constraints
- Position: $$-\infty \leq x,y,z \leq +\infty$$
- Orientation: $$\( -\pi/2 \leq \phi, \theta, \psi \leq \pi/2 \)$$
- Velocities: $$\( -5 \, \text{m/s} \leq v_x, v_y, v_z \leq 5 \, \text{m/s} \)$$
- Angular Velocities: $$\( -0.05 \, \text{rad/s} \leq \omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z \leq 0.05 \, \text{rad/s} \)$$

#### Input Constraints
- Propeller Speeds: $$\( 0 \leq u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4 \leq 1200 \)$$

### Cost Function 

The cost function is designed to minimize the error between the current state and the desired state while penalizing large control inputs. It consists of a quadratic term for state deviation and another for control effort.

$$Cost = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} ((x_i - x_p)^T Q (x_i - x_p) + u_i^T R u_i) + (x_N - x_p)^T Q_{terminal} (x_N - x_p)$$
where $$x_p$$ is desired state, $$x_i$$ is current state and $$x_N$$ is terminal state
